# Hyperbolic-Petri-Net-Simulator
Visual exploration of Petri net executions in the Poincaré disk


## Features

- Greedy forward simulation (fires first enabled transition)
- Efficient: hyperbolic distance & admissibility checked only periodically
- Deterministic 128-bit structural fingerprint (safe for negative weights)
- Natural termination detection
